# University Project Portfolio
A collection of my C and Java projects made for university classes.

### Object Oriented Programming A3
A simple investment manager made in Java, with a GUI built using Java Swing. The program provides tools for the user to update their portfolio and an advanced search to find specific investments, with full Javadoc documentation.

### Operating Systems A1
A model of memory management, where a large amount of memory is allocated at the start of the program, and different management algorithms are used to write to and clear memory. This project is intended to show the advantages and disadvantages of different memory management algorithms.

### Operating Systems A2
A simulation of a "token ring" network, where individual nodes can pass data around in a ring structure, created using multiple processes and semaphores. This project shows how data can be efficiently and reliably passed in a network.

### Systems Design and Integration A1
This project creates a shared library in C which provides functions for parsing and working with .vcard and .vcf files, the internet standard for sharing contact information. The program is compliant with [RFC6350](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6350).
