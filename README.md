# University Project Portfolio

A collection of my C and Java projects made for university classes.

### Java Investment Manager

A simple investment manager made in Java, with a GUI built using Java Swing. The program provides tools for the user to update their portfolio and an advanced search to find specific investments, with full Javadoc documentation.

### Token Ring Network

A simulation of a "token ring" network, where individual nodes can pass data around in a ring structure, created using multiple processes and semaphores. This project shows how data can be efficiently and reliably passed in a network.

### VCF File Management Interface

This project creates a shared library in C that pareses and manages .vcard and .vcf files, with contact data stored and queried using SQL. The library is fully compliant with [RFC6350](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6350). Due to its reliance on a university hosted SQL server, the full functionality can only be tested on campus.

### User Performance Analytics Module

A python module that I developed independently as part of a larger group project. The module analyzed user question attempt data stored in a SQL database and computed key performance metrics, including topic level accuracy rates, user strengths and weaknesses, and performance trends. The outputs of this module were used for a detailed user progress page.
